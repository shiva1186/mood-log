<h2>Mood Log</h2>
<p><em>by Eric Burke</em></p>

<p>
Mood Log tracks how you feel throughout the day. You can type new words
or select from a list of words you've already logged. Each log entry contains the word,
how strongly you feel, and the current date and time.
</p>

<p>
Words are limited to 30 characters -- Mood Log is not intended for complex sentences
or journal entries.
